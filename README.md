# E-Commerce-Context-Class-Component
Simple exercise with React-Context Class-Component

## About the project

- This is a simple e-commerce exercise that I built using React Class Component with Context. 

## The frontend

It was developed with [**_ReactJS_**](https://reactjs.org/) using [**Context**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to handle the state with the reducers and the actions.
[**_react-router-dom_**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) to handle the routes.
